            Angelo is a Miami based photographer, who was born and raised in South Florida where his family decided to settle down after 
            leaving Venezuela in the late 90s. He watched Miami slowly become the artistic hub it is today and decided to contribute 
            to the world of art through film photography.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was first inspired to do photography after spending
            months in Europe where he fell in love with the architecture and European lifestyle. His passion is to
            capture images in all its pureness with little to no editing done to his photos and to grow as an independent photographer.
        </p>   
        <p>
            On Angelo's free time he enjoys exploring nature, traveling, and reading books at coffee shops.
